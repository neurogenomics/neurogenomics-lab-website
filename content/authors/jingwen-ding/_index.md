I completed my bachelor’s degree in pharmacy and gained clinical experience through a one-year hospital internship as a clinical pharmacist. My undergraduate research focused on characterizing RNA-binding protein inhibitors using differential scanning fluorimetry, which sparked my interest in RNA biology.

Currently, I am pursuing an MSc in Genes, Drugs, and Stem Cells at Imperial College London and conducting my research project in the Skene Lab. My work focuses on identifying transcription factor targets that regulate microglia cell states and assessing their relevance to genetic dysregulation in Alzheimer’s disease.
