Initially specialising in biochemistry during my undergraduate degree at the University of Cambridge, I gained experience applying machine learning and statistics to biological problems during my master’s.
During my PhD, I aim to enhance machine learning models’ ability to capture individual genetic variation, particularly for predicting DNA methylation patterns. These improved models could then be used to better identify causal genetic variants underlying neurodegenerative diseases.
Outside the lab, I enjoy playing and watching football, tennis and baseball.
