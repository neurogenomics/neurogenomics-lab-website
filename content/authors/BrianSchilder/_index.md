As a researcher with experiences in a variety of fields, I am a believer in the innovation and insights that can be gained from highly inter-disciplinary research. In 2011, I earned my ScB in Cognitive Neuroscience from Brown University (Providence, RI). The core focus of my work was and continues to be the investigation of human susceptibility to diseases and disorders in order to impact human health and alleviate suffering. 

In order to uncover the evolutionary underpinnings of human-specific cognitive abilities and neurobiological susceptibilities, I then took on jobs in two labs simultaneously (as Lab Manager and Research Assistant, respectively) at The George Washington University (Washington, DC). At the same institution, I went on to earn my MPhil in Human Paleobiology (2017) investigating the neuroanatomical, transcriptomic and genomic evolution of the hippocampus, adult neurogenesis and episodic memory. During this time, I became increasingly interested applying programming and computational techniques to expand the scale and scope of the questions that I’m able to address.

In the pursuit of further advancing my skills as a computational researcher, I thereafter accepted a position as a Bioinformatician at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai (New York City, NY). There I helped to develop a number of open-access bioinformatics tools; e.g. X2K Web (https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/X2K), Geneshot (https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/geneshot), catalogueR (https://github.com/RajLabMSSM/catalogueR), echolocatoR (https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.20.212407v1). My collaborators and I also published work revealing cell-type-specific neurogenomic mechanisms underlying neurological conditions (e.g. Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s Disease) through the application of statistical and machine learning techniques to large-scale multi-omics and clinical data.
I am now pursuing my PhD in Clinical Medicine Research at Imperial College London under the advisorship of Dr. Nathan Skene. Outside of research, I also enjoy ultra-marathon running and music production.
