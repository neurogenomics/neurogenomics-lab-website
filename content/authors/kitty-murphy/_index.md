During my undergraduate degree I was fortunate enough to spend a year at the University of Melbourne, where I took the Principles of Neuroscience module. With each lecture being vastly different but just as interesting as the last, I soon realised I would never be bored as a neuroscientist. This fueled my decision to specialise in neuroscience when I returned to King’s College London for my final year of my Biomedical Science degree. 

Before completing my undergraduate degree, I had the opportunity to embark on a year-long industry placement. During this time, I conducted research on experimental therapies for sepsis and type 2 diabetes using small animal models at The William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London. After graduating, I continued my research journey, this time as a research technician in the gut signaling and metabolism laboratory at LMS, where I delved into the role and regulation of a potential intestinal glucose sensor during murine pregnancy and lactation.

In 2019 I was awarded a 4.5 year MRC DTP Studentship at Imperial College London. Having gained experience in the lab, I then wanted to understand how I could apply computational techniques to continue addressing important biological questions, especially those related to the brain. As part of my studentship I completed the MRes in Experimental Neuroscience, during which I undertook three computational projects related to evolution, genomics, epigenetics, and neurodegenerative disease. 

My diverse experiences across various fields have ultimately guided me towards my current path - becoming a computational biologist with a specialised focus on neurogenomics. I am now a PhD student in the Department of Brain Sciences/UK Dementia Research Institute at Imperial College London. If my head isn’t buried in my laptop, then I’m either cooking or eating.
