I am an MRes student in Drug Discovery and Development at Imperial College London, conducting my master project in the Skene Group at the UKDRI. My project focuses on optimising single-cell TIP-seq, an advanced technique to investigate the TF-DNA interaction. Before starting my MRes, I completed a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Molecular Life Sciences at Radboud University. My research experience spans synthetic chemistry, molecular biology and pharmacology. Outside the lab, I enjoy exploring different cultures through travel and love reading detective novels.
