I am an academic clinical fellow, meaning I work part time as a medical doctor and part time as a researcher.

I did an undergraduate master's degree in Physics at Oxford. My research project was in medical physics, working with Professor Clive Hahn to design a test system to validate oxygen measuring devices for surgery.

After graduating I worked in finance for five years, and worked at a tech start up I co-founded for a year.

I then studied medicine at Warwick Medical School and subsequently started my academic clinical training in Stoke-on-Trent. I worked with Professor Simon Davies on the Global Fluid Study using multi-level modelling on large datasets to find and assess clinical biomarkers in patients with chronic kidney disease.

During COVID I moved to London and worked in A&E. I am currently completing my GP training at the Royal Free Hospital, where I am also an honorary clinical lecturer at UCL medical school.

I am now in the process of completing a master's degree in Genomic Medicine at Imperial College London.

Outside of work I have what can only be described as a tragic level of excitement for photography. I recently discovered Instagram if you would like to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nice.slice.of.life/">see</a>.
