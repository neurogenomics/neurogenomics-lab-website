I am currently in my 3rd and final year of my Bachelor’s degree studying Medical Biosciences at Imperial College and undertaking a 20 week placement at UKDRI  developing a new multi epigenetic profiling technique of histone marks in neurodegenerative diseases under Dr Nathan Scene and Dr Maria Weinert. This advanced technique allows for a deeper understanding of the epigenetic mechanisms that regulate gene expression and their implication in neurodegenerative diseases to potentially identify epigenetic targets for novel therapeutic approaches. 

During my Bachelor’s degree I have worked in many laboratory settings aiding in a variety of research areas from HIV at Imperial College to Pancreatic Oncology in the Tuveson Lab at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratories, having these experiences in professional laboratory settings I am excited to continue my clinical skills as well as integrating the use of Python and machine learning in the context of organising multiplex sequence libraries to further develop my computational analysis repertoire. 

Having the privilege to work in multiple different sectors of the scientific field, I am able to continue broadening my horizons while simultaneously narrowing my Master’s choices as I learn more about what research areas fascinate me the most. 

Beyond academia, I am involved in multiple societies across Imperial most notably playing in the ICSM Netball team, have a passion in anything creative from painting to sculpting to crocheting and sewing and love to travel to become more culturally, linguistically and socially aware. Currently, I am training for the 2025 London Marathon in support of Pancreatic Cancer UK.
