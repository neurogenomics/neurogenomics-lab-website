Instructions on how to edit and add content on the lab's webpage can be found here https://github.com/neurogenomics/labwiki/wiki/The-Lab-Website on the lab wiki.

You can see the deploy summary on https://app.netlify.com/sites/modest-wing-c6e306/deploys by choosing the most recent deploy. Scroll down and look for the error â€“ usually errors are caused by small syntax errors.
