My research focuses on optimizing single-cell TIP sequencing to profile the epigenome of post-mortem human brains and study neuroinflammation in the context of Alzheimerâ€™s disease. Before joining the lab, I earned my medical degree from Universitas Indonesia and worked at the Oxford Clinical Research Unit, where I conducted clinical studies on tuberculous meningitis and other brain infections.
