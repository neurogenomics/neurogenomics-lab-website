My experience largely constitutes applications of AI, Data Science, and other computational methods for natural science applications, such as my dissertation projects investigating quantum computing methods for estimating the ground state energy of molecules, and applying computer vision and natural language AI methods to residue-level domain annotation of anti-freeze proteins. I look forward to deepening my understanding of genetics and applying my skillset to the important and complex domain of neurogenerative diseases.
