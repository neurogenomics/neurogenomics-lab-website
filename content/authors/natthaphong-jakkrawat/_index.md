I am passionate about neurodegenerative disease research, focusing on disease-associated microglia in Alzheimerâ€™s disease. I am currently learning lab techniques to study transcription factors and their role in microglial function. Outside the lab, I love travelling and exploring new places, as well as the freedom of driving. Whether on the road or in the lab, I enjoy discovering new perspectives and challenging myself with new experiences.
