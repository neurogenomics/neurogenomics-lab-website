Lizzie is a fourth-year medical student at Imperial College London, currently undertaking a wet lab research project as part of her intercalated BSc in Neuroscience and Mental Health. With a clinical background, she is keen to develop a range of lab-based skills, hoping to take forward the research experience into an Academic Foundation Programme during her early years as a junior doctor.

Supervised by Dr Maria Weinert, her current project focuses on modulating microglia into various phenotypic states and studying these using novel epigenetic techniques, like TIP-Seq, which the lab is actively optimising.
