I am an MRes student in Biomedical Research (General) at Imperial College London, conducting my master’s project on microglia epigenetic profiling to identify transcription factor targets relevant to Alzheimer’s disease in the Skene Lab. During my previous project at Imperial, where I investigated transcription factor regulation in multiple myeloma using genomic techniques, I developed a strong interest in genomics and its role in understanding disease mechanisms.

Through my current research, I aim to further develop my skills in epigenomics and next-generation sequencing, gaining deeper insights into gene regulation in neurodegenerative diseases. Outside the lab, I enjoy travelling and exploring new places.
