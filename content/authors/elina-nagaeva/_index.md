Being always fascinated by DNA and how it spreads through living organisms, I became a biologist, who later was hooked by a not less inspiring structure with a quite dreadful name – the Central Nervous System. I started to approach it through physiology and pharmacology of neurons, using patch-clamp as my favorite method due to its limitless ability to be combined with other methodologies, including IHC, morphology, anatomy, optogenetics, and sequencing. During this journey, I realized that even a single cell can make a meaningful impact on the system of which it is a part. Luckily, that insight aligned perfectly with the rise of single-cell sequencing technologies.

At the Neurogenomics Lab, I study the cellular heterogeneity of the human midbrain — my favourite brain region — after dedicating much of my career to exploring its rodent homologues. My goal is to better understand how well rodent models translate to human dopamine disorders. Bridging both wet- and dry-lab approaches, I aim to contribute to the translation of GWAS findings into potential treatments for human dopamine-related psychiatric and neurological conditions.
