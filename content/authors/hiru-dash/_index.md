Bioinformatics is a unique blend of everything science offers: biology, mathematics, chemistry, and physics. As a person who has always been preoccupied with how nature and technology around me work, I find it natural to drift toward this subject. With my strong background in biology, I am currently honing my quantitative and programming skill set. I aspire to develop tools propelling the frontiers of bioinformatics research.
