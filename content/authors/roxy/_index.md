I'm a second year PhD in the Skene lab funded by the [Beijing Genomics Institute](http://www.bgi.com). My undergraduate degree was in psychology at Durham University, during which I developed a great interest in human genetics and genomics through my neurobiology course and wider reading. My work on psychiatric genetics begun at Imperial in the lab of [Jackie de Belleroche](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/193071/obituary-professor-jackie-belleroche-phd-ds/). There I learnt to perform many of the experiental techniques associated with genetic research. Aware of the potential that big data has for transforming research on brain disorders, I chose to do my PhD in Nathan's lab. I'm now very happy using single cell genomic data to pursue my interests in brain function and disease by unravelling the secrets hidden in the GWAS summary statistics!
