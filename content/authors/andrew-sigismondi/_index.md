I am currently finishing year 3 of my B.S.c Medical Biosciences degree at Imperial college, and am in a 6 month placement at the UKDRI. I am working on the development and application of TIP-Seq, a cutting edge technique that aims to drastically improve the sensitivity and accuracy of current ChIP-Seq assays. Once development is completed, I hope  to use TIP-Seq to profile the binding of various transcription factors in microglia, and hopefully gain insights on the elaborate interplay of Alzheimer’s disease and epigenetics. In the last  year, I’ve worked with CRISPR in a wide range of applications, from HIV host cell factor inhibition to zebrafish eye morphogenesis and differentiation. I moved to London from Milan two years ago and have since been on my journey to become a researcher - I am always open to new experiences and challenges and I am looking forward to the next 6 months of my placement in Skene lab!
