I am a genomics enthusiast with a technical focus in data analysis and machine learning to answer biological questions. My previous experience before joining Imperial's Brain Science department include 4 years at Foundation Medicine, a Roche company, in the Cancer Genomics Research team developing biomarkers and insights in a large clinical database, and 2 years at start-up Curileum Discovery supporting drug-screening and cell therapy programs. Recently completing an MSc at UCL in Personalised Medicine and Novel Therapies, based at UCL's Great Ormond Street Institute of Child Health, has provided me with a broader view of research impact that I look to carry into working at UKDRI.
